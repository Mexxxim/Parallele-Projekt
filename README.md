# Parallele-Projekt

if you want to run the virtual enviroment you have to run the command "source venv/Scripts/activate" in the Shell 
or just "venv/Scripts/activate" in the bash. If you see a "(venv)" at the start of your command line somewhere than that means the enviroment is active.

to run the app itself its just either "flask run" or "python App.py"
